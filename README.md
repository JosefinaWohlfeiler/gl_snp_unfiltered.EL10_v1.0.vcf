#Description:
#This file, gl_snp_unfiltered.EL10_v1.0.vcf, contains unfiltered SNP variants derived from the raw SNP data provided in the DArT service outputs.
#The VCF file was generated using the gl2vcf function from the dartR package (v2) to convert the original DArT CSV files into VCF format.
#The SNPs were called by mapping the data to the sugar beet reference genome EL10 v1.0 (DOI: 10.1093/dnares/dsac033).
#No quality filters or imputation have been applied, preserving the original variants as generated during the initial processing.
